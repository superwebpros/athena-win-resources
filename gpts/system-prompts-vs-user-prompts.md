# System Prompts vs. User Prompts: The Complete Guide

*Understanding the difference between setting up AI assistants and working with them*

## What's the Difference?

Think of the relationship like this:

**System Prompts = Job Description + Office Setup + Tools**
- One-time setup that defines WHO the AI is and HOW it should behave
- **Access to persistent knowledge** (uploaded files, connected drives, specialized databases)
- **Custom tool integration** (APIs, external systems, specialized functions)
- **Prebuilt capabilities** (web search, code execution, image generation, deep research)
- Applied automatically to every interaction
- Written once, used forever

**User Prompts = Daily Task Instructions**  
- Task-specific requests for what you need RIGHT NOW
- **No persistent knowledge** - only what you provide in the conversation
- **No custom tools** - limited to the AI's basic capabilities
- **No file access** - unless you upload something in that specific chat
- Dynamic, conversational, and contextual
- Changes with every interaction
- Uses our 4-step framework from the [How to Prompt guide](../prompts/how-to-prompt.md)

## The Key Distinction: Capabilities and Context

### System Prompts Have Superpowers

**üß† Persistent Knowledge Base**
- Upload company documents, style guides, previous work samples
- Connect to Google Drive, Notion databases, or other knowledge repositories  
- Access to specialized datasets or industry-specific information
- Remembers context across all conversations

**üîß Custom Tool Integration**
- **OpenAI GPTs:** Connect to external APIs via OpenAPI specifications
- **Claude Projects:** Use Model Context Protocol (MCP) for custom integrations
- **Gemini Gems:** Integration with Google Workspace and enterprise systems
- Real-time data access, database queries, system automation

**‚ö° Prebuilt Advanced Tools**
- Web search and real-time information retrieval
- Code execution environments (Python, data analysis)
- Image generation and visual content creation
- Deep research capabilities with source citation
- File processing (PDFs, spreadsheets, documents)

### User Prompts Are Limited to Conversation

**üí≠ Conversation-Only Knowledge**
- Only knows what you tell it in that specific chat
- No access to your files, systems, or previous conversations
- Relies entirely on your prompt for context and information

**üö´ No Custom Tools**
- Cannot connect to your systems or databases
- Cannot remember preferences or past work
- Limited to basic AI model capabilities

**üìù Task-Focused and Isolated**
- Each conversation starts from scratch
- Perfect for one-time tasks and brainstorming
- Requires you to provide all necessary context

---

## When to Use Each Type

### Use System Prompts When:
‚úÖ Creating Custom GPTs, Gems, or Claude Projects  
‚úÖ Setting up AI assistants for your team  
‚úÖ You have files, documents, or knowledge to upload permanently
‚úÖ You need custom integrations with your business systems
‚úÖ You want persistent context across multiple conversations
‚úÖ Tasks require specialized tools (web search, code execution, etc.)

### Use User Prompts When:
‚úÖ Working with general AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)  
‚úÖ One-time tasks or brainstorming sessions
‚úÖ You don't need persistent knowledge or custom tools
‚úÖ Quick collaboration on isolated problems  
‚úÖ Following our 4-step prompting framework for immediate needs

## What Makes System Prompts Powerful: The Three Components

Every effective custom AI assistant (GPT, Gem, or Project) combines three elements:

### 1. **System Prompt** (The Personality)
The instructions that define behavior, expertise, and interaction style

### 2. **Knowledge Base** (The Memory)  
- **Recommended uploads:** Company documents, style guides, templates, case studies
- **Connected systems:** Google Drive, Notion, CRM databases, documentation
- **Specialized data:** Industry reports, best practices, previous project examples

### 3. **Tool Integration** (The Capabilities)
- **Prebuilt tools:** Web search, code execution, image generation, file processing
- **Custom integrations:** CRM systems, project management tools, databases
- **API connections:** External services, company systems, specialized software

### Example: Marketing Strategist GPT Setup

**System Prompt:** "You are a B2B marketing expert who asks strategic questions and provides data-driven recommendations..."

**Knowledge Base:**
- Company brand guidelines and voice document
- Previous successful campaign case studies  
- Industry benchmark reports and competitor analysis
- Marketing templates and frameworks

**Tool Integration:**
- Web search for current market trends
- Connection to company CRM for lead data
- Google Analytics API for performance metrics
- Custom calculator for ROI projections

**Result:** An AI assistant that knows your brand, has access to your data, can research current trends, and provides contextual, actionable marketing advice.

## Situation Analysis
Before recommending tactics, I need to understand your current performance:

1. **Current State**: What's your monthly lead volume and what channels are driving them?
2. **Quality Definition**: How do you define a 'qualified lead' and what's your lead-to-customer conversion rate?
3. **Resources**: What's your monthly marketing budget and team capacity?
