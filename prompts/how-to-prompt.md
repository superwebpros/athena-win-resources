## The Reality: Most People Prompt Poorly

**Common mistakes that limit results:**

- Vague instructions: *"Help me write an email"*
- No context: *"Create a presentation"*
- Single-shot thinking: *"Write a report"* (then frustrated when it's not perfect)
- Treating AI like Google: Asking for facts instead of collaboration

**The result?** Generic, unhelpful outputs that make people think "AI isn't that useful."

**The truth?** The problem isn't AI. It's prompting.

## My Top 4 Tips for Creating Effective Prompts

### Best Practice 1: Set the Context
**Get the AI ready by establishing the scenario and your role**

```
I'm a [YOUR ROLE] at [YOUR COMPANY/INDUSTRY] and I need to [SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE]. I'm looking for AI assistance to help me [DESIRED OUTCOME]. Before we start, do you understand my situation and how you can best help me with this task?
```

**Why this works:**
- Establishes your expertise and domain
- Sets clear expectations for the AI's role
- Creates a collaborative partnership from the start
- Allows AI to ask clarifying questions

### Best Practice 2: Give a Template Before "Saving" a Prompt for Re-use
Once you are working well with an Assistant, you may want to 'save' that interaction as a template for future use. In these cases, ask the assistant to reflect on the interaction and create a template for future use using the following format:

```
I would like to create a comprehensive user prompt that I can save and will help me recreate interactions similar to the one we're having. Please use this example to create a template for future use:

"""example
I want you to act as a [SPECIFIC ROLE - e.g., marketing strategist, executive coach, project manager] with expertise in [RELEVANT AREAS].

Your approach should be:
- [INTERACTION STYLE - e.g., ask clarifying questions before providing suggestions]
- [COMMUNICATION TONE - e.g., professional but conversational]
- [SPECIFIC BEHAVIORS - e.g., provide options rather than single solutions]

When working with me, always [SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS - e.g., explain your reasoning, ask for feedback before proceeding, provide actionable next steps].
"""endExample
```

**Why this works:**
- Creates a specialized AI partner for your specific needs
- Establishes consistent interaction patterns
- Ensures outputs match your working style and preferences

---

### Best Practice 3: Ask the Assistant to Think
**Get the AI to analyze and strategize before jumping to solutions**

```
Before we create anything, I'd like you to:
1. Analyze the key challenges and opportunities in this situation
2. Suggest 3-4 different approaches we could take
3. Explain the pros and cons of each approach
4. Recommend which approach would be most effective and why

What's your assessment?
```

**Why this works:**
- Engages AI's analytical capabilities
- Provides multiple options instead of single solutions
- Creates more thoughtful, strategic outputs
- Helps you make informed decisions

---

### Best Practice 4: Collaborate and Iterate
**Work together to refine and perfect the output**

```
I like approach [#] because [YOUR REASONING]. Let's proceed with that direction, but I'd like to modify [SPECIFIC ELEMENTS].

Please create [DELIVERABLE] that incorporates:
- [SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT 1]
- [SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT 2]
- [SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT 3]

After you create the first draft, please also suggest 2-3 ways we could improve or customize it further.
```

**Why this works:**
- Maintains your decision-making authority
- Creates outputs tailored to your specific needs
- Builds in improvement opportunities
- Establishes iterative working relationship

## Complete Example: Creating a Career Development Plan

**Let's see the 4-step framework in action:**

### Step 1: Set the Context
```
I'm a mid-level marketing manager at a technology company and I'm preparing for my annual performance review in 6 weeks. I want to create a comprehensive career development plan that demonstrates my commitment to growth and positions me for a promotion to senior manager within the next 18 months. I'm looking for AI assistance to help me structure this plan strategically and ensure I'm covering all the essential elements. Before we start, do you understand my situation and how you can best help me with this career planning process?
```

### Step 2: Frame the Assistant
```
I want you to act as an experienced career strategist with expertise in technology sector career advancement, particularly for marketing professionals moving into senior leadership roles.

Your approach should be:
- Ask targeted questions about my current role, achievements, and career aspirations
- Provide strategic frameworks rather than generic advice
- Consider both short-term performance review goals and long-term career objectives
- Offer specific, actionable recommendations I can implement immediately

When working with me, always explain the strategic reasoning behind your suggestions and ask for my input before moving to the next phase of the plan.
```

### Step 3: Ask the Assistant to Think
```
Before we create my career development plan, I'd like you to:
1. Analyze the key elements that make career development plans effective for promotion consideration
2. Suggest 3-4 different structural approaches for organizing my plan
3. Explain what senior leadership typically looks for when evaluating promotion readiness
4. Recommend which approach would be most compelling for a marketing professional in tech

What's your strategic assessment?
```

### Step 4: Collaborate and Iterate
```
I like approach #2 because it balances immediate performance improvements with long-term strategic skills. Let's proceed with that framework, but I'd like to modify the timeline to be more aggressive since I have specific promotion goals.

Please create a career development plan outline that incorporates:
- Specific skill gaps I should address for senior management readiness
- Measurable goals I can track and report on during my review
- Leadership development opportunities within my current role
- Industry knowledge areas that would strengthen my promotion case

After you create the first draft, please also suggest 2-3 ways I could customize this further based on my company's specific culture and values.

## Advanced Prompting Techniques

### The Power of Persona Prompting
Instead of asking AI to "write an email," create a specific persona:

❌ **Weak:** "Write a professional email declining a meeting request"

✅ **Strong:** "You are an executive assistant to a busy CEO who values relationships but needs to protect their time. Write a gracious email declining a meeting request while suggesting alternative ways to collaborate."

### Using Examples to Guide Output
Show AI exactly what you want by providing examples:

```
I need help writing project status updates. Here's an example of the format I like:

PROJECT: Website Redesign
STATUS: On Track
PROGRESS: Completed wireframes (Week 2 of 4), began visual design
BLOCKERS: Waiting for brand guideline approval from marketing
NEXT STEPS: Finalize design mockups by Friday, begin development phase
TEAM IMPACT: Designer will transition to new project next week

Now help me write status updates in this same format for my other projects.
```

### Chain of Thought Prompting
Get better reasoning by asking AI to show its work:

```
I'm trying to decide between three job offers. Walk me through a systematic decision-making process:

1. First, ask me what factors matter most in my career decision
2. Then help me score each offer based on those criteria
3. Finally, recommend which offer aligns best with my priorities

Start by asking me about my priorities.
```

## Common Prompting Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. The One-Shot Fallacy
❌ **Thinking:** "I should get perfect results on the first try"
✅ **Reality:** Great outputs come from conversation and iteration

### 2. The Google Syndrome
❌ **Asking:** "What is project management?"
✅ **Asking:** "Act as an experienced project manager and help me create a timeline for launching our new product, considering the resource constraints I'm about to describe."

### 3. The Context Drought
❌ **Vague:** "Make this email better"
✅ **Specific:** "I'm writing to a potential client who's comparing vendors. Make this email more compelling by emphasizing our unique advantages while maintaining a professional, consultative tone."

### 4. The Single Model Trap
❌ **Thinking:** "ChatGPT is the only AI I need"
✅ **Reality:** Different models excel at different tasks (Claude for analysis, ChatGPT for creativity, Gemini for research)
